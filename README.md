# Algebraic-Riccati-Equation-CPP
Solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation in C++ using the Eigen library.

Three methods have been implemented:

* Schur Decomposition
* Eigenvalue Decomposition
* Newton's Method

Currently, only the Eigenvalue Decomposition method works, and its results have been compared with MATLAB's icare function. 
Work is ongoing for the Schur Decomposition and Newton's Method.
